                A planetary nebula is the detached shell of a star at the last stage of its life with its core in the center. When the star runs out of hydrogen during thermonuclear reactions, it enters the red giant phase and begins to expand. As a result, it sheds its shell and the core of the star remains in the center of the nebula.

                These nebulae were named in antiquity because of their visual similarity to Uranus, when telescopes did not give an accurate image. The word "planetary" is still used today.

                They can have different shapes: spherical, circular, disk, non-fused, bipolar and even rectangular. What makes them take such forms is not known to this day.
